I almost certainly am missing things that you will need.  If so, please let me know and I'll try to help.

License Limitations:

    Remember, like with all of my work, I am only able to provide the following assurance(s):

    -- It is almost certainly going to work until it breaks; although I have to admit 
       it may never work and that would be sad.
    -- When/if it does break, you may keep all of the pieces.
    -- If you find my materials helpful, both you & I will be happy, at least for a little while.
    -- My advice is worth every penny you paid for it!
    
 Enjoy!
